NOTES

- in the StoreProvider file I added ALL providers, REDUX PROVIDER / THEME PROVIDER / CONTEXT PROVIDER
- it can be done separately, I found helpful using one file (remember to keep layout server side)
- providers work only on client side, therefore StoreProvider

- I kept all types separate, see types in \_utils

- navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition needs success params.
- error and options are optional, for more info read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/getCurrentPosition
